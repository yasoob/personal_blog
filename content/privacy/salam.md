Salam ("we", "our", or "the app") values your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use the Salam app. By using the app, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy.

## 1. Data Collection

**No Personal Data Collected:**

Salam does not collect, store, or share any personal information about you. We do not request any personal details such as your name, email address, or location for any purpose.

## 2. Third-Party Services

While we do not collect personal data, the app integrates with third-party services for certain features:

### 2.1 Aladhan API

Salam uses the **Aladhan API** for prayer time calculation based on your location. The Aladhan API provides accurate prayer times for various locations worldwide. For more information about Aladhan’s privacy practices, you can visit their website at [https://aladhan.com/credits-and-terms](https://aladhan.com/credits-and-terms). The Aladhan API may collect and store location data as part of its service.

### 2.2 Quran Cloud

Salam uses **https://alquran.cloud/** for Quranic audio playback and translation. This service allows us to provide high-quality recitations and translations of the Quran. For information on how Alquran Cloud handles user data, please refer to their terms and conditions at [https://alquran.cloud/terms-and-conditions](https://alquran.cloud/terms-and-conditions).

Please note that **Alquran Cloud** may collect and store information related to audio playback and translations, such as IP addresses or usage statistics, as part of their service.

## 3. Data Security

Salam does not collect or store any personal information, so there are no security risks associated with personal data within the app. However, the third-party services we use (Aladhan API and Alquran Cloud) may store certain data in accordance with their own privacy policies and data protection practices.

## 4. Your Rights

Since Salam does not collect personal data, there are no specific rights for you to exercise in relation to the data we collect. However, for any concerns about the data collection practices of the third-party services we use, you can contact them directly through their provided privacy policies.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or third-party services. We will notify users of any significant changes by updating the effective date at the top of this page. Please review this policy periodically to stay informed about how your data is protected.
