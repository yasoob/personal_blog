  Nice article! Pandas is such a powerful library. One great features is the
  ability to load data directly from a url. In the modern world is is so
  important for people to be competent at working with data. I wrote an
  introduction to data literacy with Python which some of your readers might
  find helpful. I hope you don't mind me sharing.
