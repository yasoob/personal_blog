comment: "Hii Morteza, \r\n\r\nI have a quick question. I have tried to post storie via this method. It doesn't give me an error but the stories are not posted ! \r\nI have tried to google if similiar people have this problem, but can't find it. I have read that this is not possible no more via the API of Instagram. Do you know if this is correct and this is not possible ? Or I just have made a mistake."
