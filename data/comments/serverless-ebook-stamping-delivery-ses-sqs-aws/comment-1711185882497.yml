comment: "I found this whilst looking for a similar solution. I want to have a download URL for my ebook but with a query string appended to it which is then used for the stamping. \r\n\r\nSo when a customer buys, they get an email from my CRM with the ebook download link in with the recipients email (a dynamic tag in the CRM)\r\n\r\nhttps://region.amazonaws.com/download-pdf?customer_email=JohnDoe@gmail.com\r\n\r\nIs this possible?"
