  Thanks for the awesome tutorial! I managed to connect to the eduroam using it.
  However, I'm having the issue that the command making the connection never
  seems to complete.  It says "wlan0...connection to 00:81:c4:.......:f3
  completed" and then doesn't terminate. If I interrupt the command, the
  internet connection is gone again. Is that normal, and if not, what could be
  the reason? Thanks!
