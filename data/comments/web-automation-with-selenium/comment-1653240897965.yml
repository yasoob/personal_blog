  Hey Yasoob, hope you are doing good, I was reading you article and stopped in
  between, I wanted to know if it was real project or just a frictional topic. I
  am a self python learner, could you suggest some path where by I can make my
  hands dirty by learning on CLI and Flask? Most of the resources are on blog
  creating with CRUD  operations. I am looking for real problems with hands on
  learning. Do you think you can help me in this?
