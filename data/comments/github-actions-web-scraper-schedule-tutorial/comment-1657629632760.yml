comment: "Dear Yasoob!\r\nThanks for sharing this tutorial which is very useful for me. Is there any way to save the html file in a folder inside the current repository.  In my case I am downloading an image with tables which is sent to another site to extract tables as dataframe. I still want to keep the downloaded table image which is gone after the scrap session is completed."
