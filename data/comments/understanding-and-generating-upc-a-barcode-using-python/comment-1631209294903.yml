comment: "Ran across this looking for some UPC info.  Overall, pretty cool.  I do want to point out that it seems that your assertion that that extended guards are optional is incorrect.  GS1 General Specification 5.2.3.2 Symbol height clearly states \"In EAN-13, EAN-8, UPC-A, and UPC-E barcodes, the bars (dark bars) forming the left, centre, and\r\nright guard bar patterns SHALL be extended downward by 5x (e.g., 1.65 millimetres (0.065 inch).\"\r\n\r\nhttps://gs1go2.azureedge.net/cdn/ff/mTugzXOdBT2AunS2AYC-a_Raz8C3fhmB0Urhkl_9D9M/1627291955/public/2021-07/gs1_general_specifications.pdf"
