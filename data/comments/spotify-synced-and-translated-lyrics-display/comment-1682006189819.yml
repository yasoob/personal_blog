  Hey Yasoob. Awesome work with this code, it should do exactly what I was
  looking for. I am having issues getting it running though; I tried to set up a
  conda environment and guess the dependencies but I've had no luck so far. Is
  there any chance you could document the python environment you are running
  this in, the modules and versions you are using?
