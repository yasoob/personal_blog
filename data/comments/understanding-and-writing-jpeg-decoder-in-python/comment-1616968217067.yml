comment: "Very interesting blog. I am working on code to send jpeg over a radiolink (i.e. make it more resilient to biterrors) and your article is a good basis for this.\r\nTwo questions:\r\n- what happens if the height/width of the image is not a multiple of 8?\r\n- your code only seems to work for images that have a 1:1 sampling factor). I guess this is 4:4:4 chroma subsampling.\r\nDo you have any reference to information how the files are formatted for images that have (e.g.) 4:2:2 or 4:2:0 chroma subsampling?"
