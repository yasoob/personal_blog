comment: "Helpful article, thank you so much.\r\nwhy run it takes a long time and never be stopped? your handsome face is shown on my screen, but the run isn't want to stop  :D !!!!\r\nand the second one is: why we can't change \"profile\"? When I change it, the code takes me some errors, even I try to change the resolution and reduce my picture's quality but there were past errors in the index range yet.\r\nthanks in advance."
