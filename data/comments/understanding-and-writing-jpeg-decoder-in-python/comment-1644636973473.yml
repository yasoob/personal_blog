  Hello.  I appreciate the work you put into this.  Essential lessons.  But Im
  actually testing your code one bit at a time, and am running into trouble.  I
  dont understand the comments youre getting in this article... people are
  giving high praise here, criticizing your choice of packages there. Everyones
  a critic or else they're blind.  Seems to me no one has actually cared enough
  about your work - your code - as it is, unadulterated, to try it out.
  Otherwise they'd know there was a problem.  Id appreciate a little help
  resolving it, if you can.  The BuildMatrix function in the JPEG class,
  specifically the line "code = self.huffman_tables[0 + idx].GetCode(st), is
  returning a KeyError type of error that I cant track down.  My code here is
  literally just a copy-paste of yours, following your instructions and
  replacing code as necessary. I dont know jpeg format enough, or some of these
  packages youre using well enough, to grasp what might be happening.  I need it
  to work before I can start experimenting with it.  Thanks.
