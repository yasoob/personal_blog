  Hello, my app has a blueprint structure and I use the create_app pattern in
  flask.  Because of this I have to put my 'from app import models' after my
  create_app function (which returns 'app') and thus I can't import User into
  create_app so as to initialize praetorian.  Any workarounds that don't involve
  getting away from create_app?
