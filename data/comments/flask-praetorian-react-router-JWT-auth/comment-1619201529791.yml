comment: "Hi Yassob,\r\n\r\nGreat Tutorial!\r\n\r\nThe only problem I see is when the access token expires; it's not getting refreshed using the Auth function component.\r\nI changed the JWT access token expiry to 5 mins, and after 5 mins passed, I reloaded the secret route and login route. But It did not work, and the flask debugger threw this error:\r\n\r\nNameError: name 'request' is not defined\r\n\r\nHow can I refresh the token after it is expired?\r\n\r\nThanks"
