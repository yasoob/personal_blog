comment: "Your article deserves a static comment.  However, as the author of the last article in the **Sources**, I've found some rooms of improvements for your guide.\r\n\r\n1. Staticman's v3 URL scheme has been available since eduardoboucas/staticman#219.  Your guide is still using the v2 URL scheme `/v2/entry/...`.  You might want to update your guide to that, so as to cover GitLab Pages as well.\r\n2. When I wrote my self-hosting guide (another related article to the one that you linked) last year, I've put `\"port\": 8080`.  In fact, that's unless since Heroku designates dynamically the port number.  I've just edited my article to remove that API parameter.\r\n3. The creation of `.gitkeep` can be avoided if you use `.Site.Data.comments` instead of `readDir \"data/comments\"`.  Related discussion in above linked Staticman PR: https://github.com/eduardoboucas/staticman/pull/219#issuecomment-419757921.\r\n4. You're mixing JS code with HTML in your Go-HTML template code for the reply button.  This doesn't comply with the pratice of [separation of concerns](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#Separation_of_Concerns).\r\n\r\n    ```html\r\n    <button id=\"{{ ._id }}\" class=\"btn-info\" href=\"#comment-form\" onclick=\"changeValue('fields[reply_to]', '{{ $.parentId }}')\">Reply to thread</button>\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    For a pure JS + Go-HTML (without jQuery) template of nested comment reply, you may take a look at [Hugo Swift Theme](https://github.com/onweru/hugo-swift-theme)'s `assets/js/*.js` and `layouts/partials/comments*.html`.\r\n\r\nP.S. I'm a collaborator of the aforementioned Hugo theme."
